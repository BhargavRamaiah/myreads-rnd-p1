# **My Reads**

```This project was built for the Udacity React Nanodegree Program. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate understanding of the basic structure and operation of a React-based app.```

# **Folder Structure**

After creation, your project should look like this:
```

  package.json
  package-lock.json
  yarn.lock
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`  or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`  or  `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](#deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`  or   `yarn run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
